# ARTimeNAB

This is an open source (AGPL3) and simplified version of ARTime, an anomaly detection algorithm.

ARTime was developed by Mark Hampton and this is a fork of [ARTimeNAB.jl](https://github.com/markNZed/ARTimeNAB.jl). This is a slightly modified code where some variable names are changed for the traditional ML users, a few julia examples are added, and a Multivariate Example is added (but it is simply iterating over each feature and detecting an anomaly, it does not take into feature correlation into account). Finally I have used GenAI (GLM 4.7 to document the code, so it may have errors, please commit with improvments if you find errors while going through it, Thank you.)
